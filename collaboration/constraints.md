# 📌 Constraints

This document outlines the boundaries and limitations that shape our collaborative data science project. Understanding these constraints helps us set realistic expectations, plan effectively, and work within our collective capabilities.

---

## 🌐 External Constraints

These are factors beyond our team’s direct control.

### ⏰ Time Zone Coordination
- **Global Distribution**: Team members are located in multiple time zones, making real-time collaboration difficult.
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Limited overlapping availability for synchronous discussions.
- **Response Delays**: Communication delays due to varied working hours and sleep cycles.

### 💻 Technical Infrastructure
- **Internet Connectivity**: Some members may experience unreliable or slow internet access.
- **Dataset Accessibility**: External datasets may have limited availability or update frequency.
- **Platform Dependencies**: We rely on external tools (e.g., GitHub, cloud services) which may encounter outages or access issues.

### 🎓 Professional & Academic Obligations
- **Work Commitments**: Varying job responsibilities affect availability.
- **Academic Workload**: Concurrent coursework competes for time and attention.
- **Examination Periods**: Exam schedules may temporarily reduce participation.

## 🔒 Internal Constraints

Constraints originating within our team, categorized as involuntary or voluntary.

### 🧱 Internal – Involuntary

These limitations are inherent and must be accommodated.

#### 🎓 Skill Level Variations
- **Technical Expertise**: Diverse levels of data science proficiency.
- **Tool Familiarity**: Varying comfort with tools like Python and GitHub.
- **Learning Curves**: Time required for upskilling during the project.

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Personal Commitments
- **Family Responsibilities**: Obligations at home impact availability.
- **Academic Programs**: Other study programs may limit time.
- **Conflicting Schedules**: Personal routines can make alignment challenging.

#### 🧰 Resource Limitations
- **Equipment Variations**: Unequal access to computing power and software.
- **Experience Gaps**: Differing levels of domain and technical expertise.

### ✅ Internal – Voluntary

These are self-imposed constraints to guide and support the project.

#### 📦 Project Scope Decisions
- **Beginner-Friendly Focus**: Scope tailored for all experience levels.
- **Technology Stack**: Using Python and foundational data science libraries.
- **Complexity Boundaries**: Avoiding advanced methodologies to meet the timeline.

#### 🧑‍🔧 Role Specialization
- **Documentation Leadership**: Commitment to high-quality documentation and reproducibility.
- **Python Formatting Standards**: Agreed code style and structure.
- **Quality Assurance**: Focused effort on testing, review, and refinement.

#### ⏳ Personal Prioritization
- **Academic Preparation**: Balancing work with exam preparation.
- **Learning Investment**: Deliberate time spent on upskilling during the project.
- **Communication Standards**: Emphasis on clarity, transparency, and shared understanding.

## ⚙️ Constraint Management Strategy

To operate effectively within these boundaries, we will:

- ✅ **Embrace Asynchronous Collaboration**  
  Rely on shared documentation and issue tracking to overcome time zone gaps.

- ✅ **Leverage Diverse Strengths**  
  Assign tasks based on individual strengths while encouraging upskilling.

- ✅ **Maintain Realistic Expectations**  
  Break down the work into manageable milestones with buffer time.

- ✅ **Build Flexibility into Timelines**  
  Anticipate schedule disruptions due to exams, connectivity, or commitments.

- ✅ **Foster a Supportive Team Culture**  
  Promote open communication, respect differing skill levels, and offer mentorship.
