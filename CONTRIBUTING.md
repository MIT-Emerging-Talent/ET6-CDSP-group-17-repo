##  Our Intention-Based Group Norms

We aim to maintain cognitive and affective trust across all members by committing to these shared intentions:

- **We will create a safe space** for open communication, questions, and idea sharing‚Äîensuring all members feel respected, heard, and supported.
- **We will trust each other** to fulfill tasks and commitments, maintaining accountability and reliability.
- **We will respect everyone‚Äôs time** in both real-time (synchronous) and flexible (asynchronous) communication. Flexibility is key, but responsiveness is valued.
- **We will be present and engaged** when the team needs us, and step up with commitment‚Äîespecially as deadlines approach.
- **We will embrace cultural and individual differences**, creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all.
- **We will maintain clear, open communication**, particularly during complex challenges or team deadlines.
- **We will support each other** during difficult or busy moments‚Äîno one should feel left behind or alone.
- **We will uphold honesty and transparency**, sharing feedback constructively and staying true to our shared goals.
- **We will keep it simple and fun**, remembering that collaboration should be enjoyable as well as effective.

## üîÑ Weekly Workflow

- **Weekly Catch-Up Call**: We hold regular team meetings (exact time to be confirmed in the Telegram group). A proposed agenda will be shared one day prior, and goals for the week will be discussed and set.
- **Communication**: All daily updates, questions, and informal chats happen on [Telegram](https://t.me/+ApRzOEobgrM3YjZk).
- **Task Ownership**: When a team member takes a task, we trust it will be completed unless communicated otherwise. Missed meetings must be covered by ensuring your deliverable is still submitted.

---

## üß† Discussion & Decision-Making

- We begin with **discussion** to understand the issue.
- We move to **debate**, presenting pros and cons of possible paths.
- After thoughtful input, we **vote**, and **majority vote determines** the decision.
- All voices are welcome, and disagreement is part of the process‚Äînot a personal conflict.

## üîß When Trust Breaks

We‚Äôre human‚Äîwe all make mistakes. When trust falters:

- Communicate first. Most issues can be resolved with an honest conversation.
- Focus on the **process**, not the person. We criticize problems, not people.
- Reflect together and rebuild. Accountability and forgiveness go hand in hand.
- If a member consistently disappears or withdraws, the team may redistribute responsibilities as needed.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è What Respect Looks Like

- Showing up.
- Listening to others.
- Offering help during challenges.
- Responding to communication.
- Being open to new ideas and different perspectives.

What **disrespect** looks like:

- Ignoring messages or avoiding responsibilities.
- Dismissing contributions or judging others unfairly.
- Being unresponsive when the team depends on you.
